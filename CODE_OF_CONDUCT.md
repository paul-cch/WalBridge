# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
  of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons
for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
Examples of representing our project include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it privately to the
maintainer through GitHub contact channels. If GitHub private vulnerability
reporting is enabled, use it for sensitive reports.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers
will respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may apply these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction
within the project community.
